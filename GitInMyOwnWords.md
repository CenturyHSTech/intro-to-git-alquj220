# Git in my Own words
## What is Git
Git is a helpful tool for keeping an eye on all changes to your code and collaborations. In technical terms, Git is a distributed Version Control System. When using Git, you can go back to any older version of your code if you wish. If you ever need to revert back to an older version, you're in luck. Git is super friendly if you're willing to collaborate with others as well. Now that you know what Git is, GitHub is a site thats puts the power of Git alltogether with a friendly user-interface. Some of the most complex technologies are home in GitHub.
